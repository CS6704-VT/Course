# Project

Software is increasingly impacting the entire world, ubiquitous in nearly every area of our lives. Software engineering is a complex activity, involving numerous sources of complexity and coordination to develop and maintain high quality software. Humans are important components of software engineering---if not the most important---as software engineers are responsible for almost all software development and maintenance tasks. To that end, the goal for the CS6704 course project this semester will be to conduct a research project that explores some facet of humans in software engineering.

### Learning Outcomes
* Synthesize research findings and implications from software engineering-related publications
* Develop research questions and study methodologies to enhance software engineering
* Develop research skills working on a team or individual project
* Communicate details about software engineering research and industry concepts

## Guidelines
The only requirements for the project is that it is research-based and fits into the overall theme of the class, exploring software engineering as a human activity. Otherwise, you are given the freedom to satisfy this goal however you wish. You may work with a team or individually, and must complete various deliverables throughout the semester. You are also welcome to reuse your current in-lab research, if it is relevant to the class theme. 

Try to be creative when selecting a project idea. **A challenging project with an unknown or negative outcome is more interesting than an easy project with an expected outcome.** If the project doesn't go well, explain why in your report and final presentation. If the project does go well, let's see if we can publish it! Negative results or an incomplete project will not impact your grade, given a valid reason ("We ran out of time" is not a valid reason). If you have difficulty coming up with ideas for your project, check out [this list](IDEAS.md) of examples or feel free to visit my office hours to discuss.

**Technology:** All materials for the project (i.e., code, survey or interview questions, and other study materials) must be maintained in a GitHub repository.

## Deliverables

You will submit your project in multiple milestones throughout the semester. Please see the schedule below:

| Deliverable (Project Grade %)    |  Deadline       |

| __Proposal Document (15%)__      | Feb 9 |
| __Project Check-In (2.5%)__        | March 15 |
| __Report Abstract (2.5%)__         | Apr 19 |
| __Project Report (5%)__         | April 26 |
| __Peer Reviews (5%)__            | May 1 |
| __Final Report (25%)__           | May 8 |
| __Final Presentation (25%)__     | **TBD** |
| __Retrospective (5%)__           | **TBD** |


__Late Policy:__ No late work will be accepted unless there are extreme circumstances or excused absences approved by the instructor. All deliverables must be turned in by 11:59pm on the given due date unless otherwise specified.
