# Lightning Talk

For this milestone, you will present a lightning talk to introduce your project to the class. Part of your evaluation for this milestone will be your ability to define a problem statement and explain how you plan to explore or address the problem through your project.

## Problem Statement

Remember, we are solving problems related to human aspects of software engineering. This does not include any general SE problem, but it must focus on problems software engineers face in SE contexts (i.e., communication, SE processes, remote work meetings, etc.). A good problem statement describes:

* **_What_ is the problem?**
* **_Why_ is it a problem?**

This content should be included at the very beginning of your lightning talk (and in the introduction of your design proposal). 

## Additional Guidelines

Your lightning talk should provide answers to the following: 

* What does your project do? 
* Why is your proposed work a good solution for the problem?
* How is your project relevant to the theme of this class?

You/your group must complete an oral proposal presentation during class provding an overview of the project you wish to complete for the semester. You may divide the presenting duties among your team however you wish, but the talk must be no more than 6 minutes. There will also be a brief time of Q&A from students after each presentation on your proposed work. The proposal oral presentation will be graded according to [this rubric](../resources/rubrics/lightning_talk.pdf).
