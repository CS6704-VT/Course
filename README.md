# CS-6704: Advanced Topics in Software Engineering

>### **Software Engineering is a Human Activity**

#### Course Description

As technology advances and societal dependence on digital products increases, modern software is evolving to be increasingly complex. To streamline this effort, a large number of tools, systems, and processes have been introduced to automate various tasks related to software development. Despite recent innovations to automate these tasks--software engineering is still a *human activity*, relying on the efforts of software developers to understand requirements, design, implement, test, maintain, and deploy applications. However, the increasing complexity of programs increases the burden on software engineers and makes it more difficult to produce high-quality of software systems.

This seminar course will explore a variety topics exploring existing challenges and evaluating novel solutions to support humans in software engineering. The format of the class will include lectures, paper presentations, discussions of state-of-the-art research concepts, workshops to gain exposure to practical software engineering tools and principles, and semester-long projects relevant to the course. By the end of this course, students should be able to discuss and design research experiments evaluating human aspects of software engineering.
