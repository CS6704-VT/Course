# Project Ideas

Below are some sample ideas of broad research topics that would be relevant to work on for the course project. Feel free to contact the instructor if you have questions about any of these.

### Tools:
* **AskAResearcher:** Develop an online platform for industry practitioners to ask research-based questions to SE researchers.
* **ResearchBot:** Implement a bot to automatically reply to questions in online programming communities (i.e., StackOverflow) with summarized findings from research papers.

### RQs:
* How have the recent tech layoffs impacted contributions to open source software projects?
* How do software development teams select deployment strategies?
* How do programmers communicate/collaborate with AI tools (i.e. GitHub Copilot) compared to humans?
* How do programmers explain things to (a) peers, (b) new team members, (c) management, and (d) users? How and why do these differ?
* How can software engineers be more fairly and accurately assessed (in industry, interview, or educational contexts)?
